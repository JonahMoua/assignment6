// The calculations for the cache hits and misses in g follow the same logic as in the f procedure.
// The pattern of hits and misses may not continue throughout the execution of the procedure. 
// The reason is that, in the row-major memory layout, the memory accesses for different columns (j) may not be in contiguous locations, causing cache misses. 
// As the procedure iterates through the columns, the memory accesses will be at different locations, and the cache may not be able to maintain a consistent hit pattern.
// The specific pattern will depend on the alignment and arrangement of ColorPoint structures in memory.

// SUMMARY
// In summary, the primary difference between functions f and g is their memory access pattern: f uses a row-major order, and g uses a column-major order. 
// The efficiency of these patterns in terms of cache hits and misses can depend on various factors and may vary based on the specific context and hardware.

//   The relative speed of f and g can be influenced by the memory access patterns and how well
//   these patterns align with the cache organization. The f function accesses memory in a
//   row-major order, while the g function accesses memory in a column-major order.
  
//   The performance may depend on the specific characteristics of the CPU cache, such as cache line size,
//   cache associativity, and the presence of optimizations performed by the compiler.
  
//   In some cases, f may exhibit better spatial locality, resulting in more cache hits,
//   while g may suffer from cache misses due to a less cache-friendly access pattern.
//   So therefore, f will be more efficent but there are factors in which can influence the run time. 
  
//   However, the actual performance can be influenced by various factors, and the results may vary
//   based on the specific hardware architecture and compiler optimizations.
